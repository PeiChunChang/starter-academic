abstract: Robust face recognition under illumination variations is a critical
  problem in a face recognition system, particularly for face recognition in the
  wild. In this paper, a face image preprocessing approach, called spatial
  expansion local histogram equalization (SELHE), is proposed to enhance face
  images due to illumination variations. First, a face image is divided into
  several non-overlapped blocks. Then, local histogram equalization with spatial
  expansion is proposed to enhance the contrast of each local image block. Local
  linear regression classification will then be used to recognize the enhanced
  image blocks. Experiments performed on the Yale B and Yale B extended
  databases have shown that the proposed approach yields promising recognition
  accuracy.
